IEEE Summer Project Algorithms and Data Structures.

				Full course plan

Duration : 9-10 Weeks.

1) Time complexity / Analysis of Algorithms and Basics of C++ (1 week)
	- Analysis of Algorithms (Master's theorem).
	- Basic maths involved.
	- Will teach specific things which are used in Competitive programming. Example : Classes etc.
	- Problem solving sessions using just C++.

2) STL ( 1 week) 
	- Important functions and data structures.	
	
	-- Contest after this. Basic ADHOCs

3) Greedy ( 1 week)
	- Proving correctness.
	- how is it different from DP.
	- Problem discussion. 

	-- Small contest or practice after this

4) Dynamic Programming ( 2 Weeks)
	- Recursions
	- Recursion + Memoization.
	- Iterative.
	- Top-down/Bottom-up approach discussion.	
	- Basic Dynamic programming problems.
	- How to handle DP problems (Making Subproblems, Optimization).

	-- Contest after this

5) Segments trees/ Binary Indexed Trees. ( 1 Week)
	- Segment trees.
	- ST with Lazy propagation.
	- BIT.
	- Comparison between BIT and Segment Trees. ( Code minimisation).

6) Graphs & Trees (2 week)
	- Graph representations (Adjacency list/Matrix etc).
	- Graph traversal algorithms.
	- Shortest path algorithms. 
	If time permits 
		- Dp with Trees.
		- Tries.

	-- Contest after this

After each Topic discussion, few good problems will be discussed from SPOJ, Codeforces and Codechef.

-Grand contest. ACM/ICPC Style (Probably last week).
-hackerrank Tshirts for the winning team from 1st year. Will be working with Webclub for this. All the year students can take part.
