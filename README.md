IEEE Summer Project Algorithms and Data Structures.

				Full course plan

Duration : 9-10 Weeks.

1) Time complexity / Analysis of Algorithms and Basics of C++ (1 week)
	
	- Analysis of Algorithms (Master's theorem).
	
	- Basic maths involved.
	
	- Will teach specific things which are used in Competitive programming. Example : Classes etc.
	
	- Problem solving sessions using just C++.


2) STL ( 1 week) 

	- Important functions and data structures.	
	

	-- Contest after this. Basic ADHOCs



3) Greedy Algorithms ( 1 week)
	
	- Proving correctness.
	
	- how is it different from DP.
	
	- Problems discussion. 

	
	-- Small contest or practice after this


4) Dynamic Programming ( 2 Weeks)
	
	- Recursions
	
	- Recursion + Memoization.
	
	- Iterative approach

	- Top-down/Bottom-up approach discussion.	

	- Basic Dynamic programming problems.

	- How to handle DP problems (Making Subproblems, Optimization).


	-- Contest after this


5) Segments trees/ Binary Indexed Trees. ( 1 Week)

	- Segment trees.

	- ST with Lazy propagation.

	- BIT.

	- Comparison between BIT and Segment Trees. ( Code minimisation).


6) Graphs & Trees (2 week)

	- Graph representations (Adjacency list/Matrix etc).

	- Graph traversal algorithms.

	- Shortest path algorithms. 

	If time permits 

		- Dp with Trees.

		- Tries.


	-- Contest after this


-After each Topic discussion, few good problems will be discussed from SPOJ, Codeforces and Codechef.

- All the Sessions will be held on #IEEE-SP-CP

- Few hangouts sessions might be there.


-Grand contest. ACM-ICPC Style (Probably last week).

-Hackerrank Tshirts for the winning team from 1st year. Will be working with Webclub for this. This will be a Public contest. Anyone can take part.
