[2016-05-11 21:24:46] <anand16__> normal way would be to just implement the algorithm in any language, execute it on a computer and measure the time taken
[2016-05-11 21:25:00] <anand16__> but this depends on a lot of factors like the language chosen, implementation, hardware, etc,.

[2016-05-11 21:25:10] <anand16__> whereas what we're really interested in is to find the running time of the algorithm in terms of its input

[2016-05-11 21:27:03] <anand16__> this can be done by finding the number of simple operations performed by the algorithm on a given input

[2016-05-11 21:29:47] <anand16__> different languages are implemented in different ways ... for example same piece of code written in c would take less time compared to that written in java 
[2016-05-11 21:30:21] <Salman_Shah> Does it depend on level of abstraction then>
[2016-05-11 21:30:23] <Salman_Shah> ?*

[2016-05-11 21:32:44] <Guest21928> Amount of data hidden?
[2016-05-11 21:33:27] <Tushaar> I guess it's the amount of complexity with which a program is written.
[2016-05-11 21:34:05] <anand16__> abstraction can be related to complexity ... for example  c is more complex when compared with python

[2016-05-11 22:06:54] <kapilvshst> Why we r going upto sqrt of n not half of n or other

[2016-05-11 22:09:22] <anand16__> suppose n is not prime it must have atleast two divisors other than 1 and n

[2016-05-11 22:09:47] <anand16__> one of them has to be less than sqrt(n) and the other greater than sqrt(n)
[2016-05-11 22:10:30] <anand16__> if no such number less than or equal to sqrt(n) is found ... then it implies that no divisor exists after sqrt(n)
[2016-05-11 22:10:37] <anand16__> got it ?

[2016-05-11 22:11:01] <kapilvshst> Ok i got
[2016-05-11 22:11:16] <mohitreddy1996> Okay so few more examples.

[2016-05-11 22:12:02] <mohitreddy1996> check this code.
[2016-05-11 22:12:20] <mohitreddy1996> So this is a sample linear search code.
[2016-05-11 22:12:44] <mohitreddy1996> So worst case will be when the item to be searched is the last element
[2016-05-11 22:12:59] <mohitreddy1996> So then you are actually traversing the whole array once.
[2016-05-11 22:13:23] <mohitreddy1996> So here the complexity is pretty straight forward : O(n)
[2016-05-11 22:13:28] <mohitreddy1996> Linear time.

[2016-05-11 22:14:56] <mohitreddy1996> This is a sample code for binary search.

[2016-05-11 22:15:27] <mohitreddy1996> Main conditions to be satisfied : Array should be sorted.
[2016-05-11 22:15:37] <mohitreddy1996> Only then binary search works

[2016-05-11 22:16:20] <mohitreddy1996> First we check the middle element. If the element is the one which we are searching for,  return 
[2016-05-11 22:16:49] <mohitreddy1996> else check if it is smaller, If yes take the first half(Smaller half) else the second half(Greater than key)
[2016-05-11 22:17:03] <mohitreddy1996> So we repeat this till we get the key.
[2016-05-11 22:17:11] <mohitreddy1996> Ex : 1 2 3 4 5 
[2016-05-11 22:17:17] <mohitreddy1996> We are searching for 4

[2016-05-11 22:18:00] <mohitreddy1996> Array : 1 2 3 4 5
[2016-05-11 22:18:00] <mohitreddy1996> Middle element 3, smaller than 4 so we take the second half, i.e 3 4 5 or 4 5 depending on the code you write.
[2016-05-11 22:18:19] <mohitreddy1996> perform same operation and we get 4 here.

[2016-05-11 22:18:31] <mohitreddy1996> So time complexity here would be O(logn)
[2016-05-11 22:18:36] <mohitreddy1996> how ?
[2016-05-11 22:18:50] <mohitreddy1996> we divide the array into 2 every single time

[2016-05-11 22:19:06] <mohitreddy1996> meaning we get the array half the size of the previous one
[2016-05-11 22:19:20] <mohitreddy1996> Worst case, we can find the element when the size of the array is 1.
[2016-05-11 22:19:29] <mohitreddy1996> So lets say n is the size of the array

[2016-05-11 22:19:46] <mohitreddy1996> n , n/2 , n/4, n/8 .... 1
[2016-05-11 22:20:01] <mohitreddy1996> So basically it is n/(2^x) = 1
[2016-05-11 22:20:07] <mohitreddy1996> n = (2^x)
[2016-05-11 22:20:12] <mohitreddy1996> x = logn
[2016-05-11 22:20:21] <mohitreddy1996> That will be our worst case.
[2016-05-11 22:20:33] <mohitreddy1996> any doubts?
